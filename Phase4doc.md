#Phase 4 report

###State of the project

In the final phase we ran into some difficulty sticking to our plan, although we ended with a demo with some working features our final product fell short of our original goals. In this phase the team wasn't able to maintain it's regular meeting scheudle as other courses and commitments consumed most of the time available during the phase.
